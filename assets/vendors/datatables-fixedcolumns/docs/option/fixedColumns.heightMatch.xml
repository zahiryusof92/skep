		<description>
			The algorithm to use. This can be one of (see below for full description):

			* `-string none`
			* `-string semiauto`
			* `-string auto`

	<default value="semiauto">
		The `-string semiauto` algorithm is used.
	</default>

	<description>
		FixedColumns operates by cloning the cells from the original table and then inserting them into the document, positioned visually above the DataTable - thus allowing them to appear fixed.

		As the fixed columns are separate HTML tables from the main table the row heights for the two must be matched - otherwise misalignment can occur.

		FixedColumns has three different algorithms that it can use:

		* `-string none` - will result in no height matching being applied by FixedColumns (height matching could be forced by CSS in this case)
		* `-string semiauto` - whereby the height calculation will be performed once, and the result cached to be used again
		* `-string auto` - height matching is performed on every draw (slowest but must accurate).
